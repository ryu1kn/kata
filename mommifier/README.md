You cannot use regular expressions to solve this problem

> ## TL;DR
>
> You are given strings of different lengths. If the number of vowels are more than 30% of the string length then replace "mommy" for each continuous set of vowels.
>
> ## Examples
>
> * "hmm" will become "hmm" (no vowels)
> * "his" will become "hmommys" (vowels are more than 30%)
> * "hear" will become "hmommyr" and not "hmommymommyr" (continuous set of vowels)
